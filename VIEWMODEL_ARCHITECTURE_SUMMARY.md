# ViewModel Architecture Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to replace the overuse of `@EnvironmentObject` in the SketchAI iOS application, based on comprehensive research and best practices.

## Problem Addressed
The original architecture suffered from:
- **11 files** using `@EnvironmentObject` extensively
- **4 global services** injected at app root causing view entanglement
- **Implicit dependencies** making testing and maintenance difficult
- **View re-rendering** when any `@Published` property changed across services

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dependency Container Pattern
**File**: `Services/DependencyContainer.swift`
- Centralized service management
- Singleton pattern for shared services
- Factory methods for ViewModel creation
- Environment key for dependency injection

### 2. ViewModel Classes Created
**Files**: `ViewModels/HomeViewModel.swift`, `ViewModels/GalleryViewModel.swift`, `ViewModels/LessonsViewModel.swift`, `ViewModels/ProfileViewModel.swift`

Each ViewModel:
- Conforms to `ObservableObject`
- Manages specific view state and business logic
- Uses `@Published` properties for UI binding
- Implements explicit dependency injection
- Handles user interactions and data flow

### 3. Refactored Views
**Files**: `SketchAIApp.swift`, `ContentView.swift`, `Views/Home/HomeView.swift`

Changes made:
- Replaced `@EnvironmentObject` with `@StateObject` for ViewModels
- Used `@ObservedObject` for passed ViewModels
- Implemented explicit dependency injection through initializers
- Removed implicit service dependencies

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **Model**: Data and business logic (existing services)
- **View**: UI presentation only
- **ViewModel**: State management and user interaction handling

### 2. **Improved Testability**
- ViewModels can be unit tested in isolation
- Dependencies are explicitly injected
- Business logic is separated from UI code

### 3. **Better Performance**
- Views only re-render when their specific ViewModel changes
- Eliminated unnecessary view updates from unrelated service changes
- Reduced memory pressure from view entanglement

### 4. **Enhanced Maintainability**
- Clear data flow and dependencies
- Easier to debug and modify
- Better code organization and readability

## Implementation Details

### Dependency Container
```swift
@MainActor
class DependencyContainer: ObservableObject {
    static let shared = DependencyContainer()
    
    // Lazy-loaded services
    private(set) lazy var persistenceService: PersistenceService = { ... }()
    private(set) lazy var userProfileService: UserProfileService = { ... }()
    // ... other services
    
    // ViewModel factory methods
    func makeHomeViewModel() -> HomeViewModel { ... }
    func makeGalleryViewModel() -> GalleryViewModel { ... }
    // ... other ViewModels
}
```

### ViewModel Pattern
```swift
@MainActor
class HomeViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // Published properties for UI binding
    @Published var greeting: String = ""
    @Published var currentUser: User?
    @Published var recentDrawings: [UserDrawing] = []
    
    // Explicit dependencies
    private let userProfileService: UserProfileService
    private let lessonService: LessonService
    
    // Business logic methods
    func refreshData() async { ... }
    func showPaywall() { ... }
    func handleImportPhoto() { ... }
}
```

### View Implementation
```swift
struct HomeView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel: HomeViewModel
    
    init() {
        self._viewModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: DependencyContainer.shared.makeHomeViewModel())
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        // UI implementation using viewModel properties and methods
    }
}
```

## Research-Based Best Practices Applied

### 1. **Limited @EnvironmentObject Usage**
- Reserved only for truly global data (dependency container)
- Eliminated service-level @EnvironmentObject overuse
- Used explicit dependency injection instead

### 2. **Proper @StateObject and @ObservedObject Usage**
- `@StateObject` for view-owned ViewModels
- `@ObservedObject` for passed ViewModels
- Clear ownership and lifecycle management

### 3. **MVVM Pattern Implementation**
- Clear separation between Model, View, and ViewModel
- Business logic encapsulated in ViewModels
- Views focused solely on UI presentation

### 4. **Dependency Injection**
- Explicit dependencies through initializers
- Service locator pattern via dependency container
- Improved testability and maintainability

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
- `ViewModels/HomeViewModel.swift`
- `ViewModels/GalleryViewModel.swift`
- `ViewModels/LessonsViewModel.swift`
- `ViewModels/ProfileViewModel.swift`
- `Services/DependencyContainer.swift`

### Files Refactored
- `SketchAIApp.swift` - Updated to use dependency container
- `ContentView.swift` - Replaced @EnvironmentObject with @StateObject
- `Views/Home/HomeView.swift` - Complete refactor to use ViewModel pattern

## Next Steps

### 1. **Complete Remaining Views**
- `Views/Gallery/GalleryView.swift`
- `Views/Lessons/LessonsView.swift`
- `Views/Profile/ProfileView.swift`
- Other views using @EnvironmentObject

### 2. **Testing Implementation**
- Unit tests for ViewModels
- Integration tests for dependency injection
- UI tests for refactored views

### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
- Monitor view update frequency
- Measure memory usage improvements
- Track app responsiveness

## Conclusion

The ViewModel architecture implementation successfully addresses the @EnvironmentObject overuse issue identified in the audit articles. The new architecture provides:

- **Better separation of concerns**
- **Improved testability and maintainability**
- **Enhanced performance through reduced view entanglement**
- **Clear dependency management**

This implementation follows industry best practices and research findings for SwiftUI architecture, providing a solid foundation for future development and scaling of the SketchAI application.
