# üîß Export Crash Fix - Privacy Permissions Added

## üö® **Problem Identified**
The app was crashing when users tried to export their art due to missing privacy permissions. The crash report showed:

**Error**: `This app has crashed because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description. The app's Info.plist must contain an NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.`

**Root Cause**: TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) framework was blocking access to the photo library because the app lacked the required privacy permission descriptions.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented**

### **Privacy Permissions Added to Info.plist**

1. **NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription**
   - **Purpose**: Allows reading from photo library
   - **Description**: "SketchAI needs access to your photo library to save your drawings and export them as images or videos."

2. **NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription**
   - **Purpose**: Allows adding images to photo library
   - **Description**: "SketchAI needs access to save your drawings to your photo library so you can share them with others."

3. **NSCameraUsageDescription**
   - **Purpose**: Allows camera access for photo import
   - **Description**: "SketchAI needs access to your camera to import photos for drawing lessons and reference images."

4. **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription**
   - **Purpose**: Allows microphone access for video recording
   - **Description**: "SketchAI needs access to your microphone for video recording features when creating timelapse videos of your drawing process."
