# User-Friendly Messaging Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the "User-Friendly Messaging - Replace technical terms with encouraging language" recommendation from the audit article. This addresses the core issue where the app was using technical jargon that didn't resonate with users, replacing it with encouraging, accessible language that fosters artistic growth.

## Problem Addressed
