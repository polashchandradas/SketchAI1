💡 [ARTISTIC ANALYSIS] Generated 1 suggestions
🌟 [ARTISTIC ANALYSIS] Encouragement: 🌟 Wow! You're becoming an amazing artist - your skills are really shining!
🎨 [ARTISTIC ANALYSIS] ========================================
```

## 🎯 **What Happens for Different Scenarios**

### **✅ Correct Line (Accuracy ≥ 0.7)**
- **Core ML**: High confidence, shape match = YES
- **Feedback**: Is correct = true
- **Visual**: Show visual feedback = false (no correction needed)
- **Message**: Encouraging messages like "🌟 Wow! You're following the guide like a pro artist!"

### **❌ Incorrect Line (Accuracy < 0.7)**
- **Core ML**: Lower confidence, shape match = NO
- **Feedback**: Is correct = false
- **Visual**: Show visual feedback = true (show corrections)
- **Message**: Helpful guidance like "🎯 Try to follow the guide shape a bit more closely - you're doing great!"

### **⚠️ Memory Pressure**
```
⚠️ [CANVAS COORDINATOR] Skipping stroke analysis due to high memory pressure (level: 2)
```

### **⏱️ Throttling**
```
⏱️ [CANVAS COORDINATOR] Throttling analysis - too soon since last analysis
```

## 📱 **How to View the Logs**

### **In Xcode:**
1. Open Xcode
2. Run your app in the simulator
3. Open the **Console** (View → Debug Area → Console)
4. Start drawing on the canvas
5. Watch the real-time logs as you draw

### **In Terminal:**
```bash
# Run the app and see logs
cd /Users/m1/Documents/SketchAI1
xcodebuild -project SketchAI.xcodeproj -scheme SketchAI -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build
```

## 🔧 **Log Categories**

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `🎨 [STROKE ANALYSIS]` | Main stroke analysis process | Starting analysis, results |
| `🧠 [CORE ML ANALYSIS]` | Core ML model predictions | Model loading, predictions |
| `💬 [FEEDBACK GENERATION]` | Feedback message creation | Suggestion generation |
| `🎨 [CANVAS COORDINATOR]` | Canvas coordination | UI updates, analysis calls |
| `👁️ [VISUAL FEEDBACK]` | Visual feedback display | Show/hide corrections |
| `🎯 [DTW FEEDBACK]` | DTW-specific feedback | Accuracy calculations |
| `🎨 [ARTISTIC ANALYSIS]` | Artistic quality analysis | Composition, style analysis |

## 🎯 **Key Metrics Tracked**

- **Stroke Points**: Number of points in the stroke
- **Target Shape**: What shape you're trying to draw
- **Core ML Confidence**: How confident the AI is (0.0-1.0)
- **Accuracy Score**: How accurate your stroke is (0.0-1.0)
- **Analysis Time**: How long analysis takes (milliseconds)
- **Is Correct**: Whether the stroke meets the threshold (≥0.7)
- **Suggestions Count**: Number of feedback suggestions generated
- **Artistic Score**: Overall artistic quality (0.0-1.0)

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **Real-time Visibility**: See exactly what the AI is thinking
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track analysis speed and accuracy
3. **Debugging**: Identify issues with stroke recognition
4. **User Experience**: Understand why certain feedback is given
5. **Optimization**: Monitor memory pressure and throttling
