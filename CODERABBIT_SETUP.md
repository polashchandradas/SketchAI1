### 3. GitHub Repository Setup

1. Create a GitHub repository if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   # In your SketchAI project directory
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/SketchAI.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 4. Configure Repository Secrets

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Add the following secrets:

   - `CODERABBIT_TOKEN`: Your CodeRabbit API token
